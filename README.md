# Binary Search

Implement a binary search function that, given a sorted list and an element to
look for, returns the index of the element in the list or -1 if the element is
not there.

Use the template in `code.js`. The tests in `code.test.js` will be run
automatically every time you push to Github; if they pass you are done.

implemented a "answer" variable that would store the target, used this to take care of the duplicate number case which failed me the first time
by having it explore the left side of the array in case there was a first iteration of the number before
